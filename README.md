# OWAMGasWorkOrdersCostSummary is an SSRS report that pulls data from Oracle and SQL Server. 

The interesting part of this story is that the gas department spent days creating the report for the department director. I have a friend who would query the Oracle data and another who queried the GIS SQL Data.
The new director took over the department and said there must be a better way. Neither of my colleagues is well versed in SSRS. They told the director that what he was asking for could not be done. I happend to be walking by and overheard the conversation and said I could do it.
There are a lot of people who have more expertise in SSRS, but I am always trying to learn new tricks. I might as well add that I planing on importing some SSRS reports into Power BI.

Attached is the SSRS project. Unfortunately, you cannot see it in action. But I can show you an example report.(https://bit.ly/3POvmY5)
